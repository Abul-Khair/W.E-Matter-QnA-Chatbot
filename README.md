   This will start the chatbot interface in your browser.

### **Repository Structure**
- `chatbot.py`: The main file that runs the Streamlit-based chatbot interface.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies required to run the chatbot.
- `interview_qnda_model/`: Directory where the model files should be stored (created by you).

### **Usage**
Once the Streamlit app is running, you can enter interview-related questions, and the chatbot will generate responses based on the trained model.

### **Notes**
- The model files are required to run the chatbot. Make sure you download them from the provided Google Drive link and place them in the `interview_qnda_model` directory.
- The chatbotâ€™s responses are generated based on patterns learned from the training data. Always verify the generated responses, especially in professional settings.
